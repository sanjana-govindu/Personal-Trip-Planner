        <p>

            Your privacy is important to us. You’ve placed your trust in us by using our services, and we value that trust. That means we’re committed to protecting and safeguarding any personal data you give us. We act in our customers' interest and are transparent about the processing of your personal data.
            <br /><br />
            This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of Personal Data that we receive through our Services. Please read it carefully, and Happy Travels!
            <br /><br />


        </p>
        <p><strong style="font-size:25px"> Collection and Use of Personal Data</strong></p>
        <p>
            Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Services, to administer your use of the Services (including your Account, if you are an Account holder), and to enable you to enjoy and easily navigate our Services.
            <br /><br />
            <u>Account Information.</u> If you create an Account, we’ll collect certain Personal Data that can be used to identify you, such as your name and email address (“PII”). If you create an Account using your login credentials from one of your SNS Account or other Accounts, we’ll be able to access and collect your name, email address, profile information, and other PII that your privacy settings on the SNS Account or other Accounts permit us to access. This Personal Data is used to ensure the security and privacy of your information. Your Personal Data may also be used to provide you with a more personalized experience when using our Services, for example.
            <br /><br />
            <u>Trip Information.</u> If you use our Services, you may provide Personal Data regarding your travel plans, schedules, preferences, bookings, notes, attachments, and other such information. In addition you may provide Personal Data about other Users who are traveling with you. We use this Personal Data to provide better Services to you and to those traveling with you. This may include sending emails, notifications, messages, etc. containing reminders, advertisements, and deals relevant to your trip.
            <br /><br />
            <u>Personal Data Collected Using Cookies and other Web Technologies.</u> Like many website owners and operators, we use automated data collection tools such as Cookies and Web Beacons to collect certain Personal Data. For additional information regarding our use of Cookies and other Web technologies, such as Web Beacons, please see our Cookie Policy <a href="cookiep.html"><link />Cookie Policy</a>.
            <br /><br />
            <u>Personal Data Related to Use of the Services.</u> Our servers automatically record certain information about how a person uses our Services (we refer to this information as “Log Data”), including both Account holders and non-Account holders (either, a “User”). Log Data may include Personal Data such as a User’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, operating system, the web page that a User was visiting before accessing our Services, the pages or features of our Services to which a User browsed and the time spent on those pages or features, which third-party website hosted the Services that brought a User the Services, search terms, information a User inputs related to their trip planning, adjustments made to existing itinerary, the links on our Services that a User clicked on, clickstream, session playback and statistics. We use Log Data to administer the Services and we analyze (and may engage third-parties to analyze) Log Data to improve, customize and enhance our Services by expanding their features and functionality and tailoring them to our Users’ needs and preferences. We may use a person’s IP address to generate aggregate, non-identifying information about how our Services are used. We may use it to improve your experience with the site, for example, to automatically determine the start and end city for your trip.
            <br /><br />
            <u>Personal Data Sent by Your Mobile Device.</u> We collect certain information that your mobile device sends when you use our Services, like a device identifier, user settings and the operating system of your device, as well as information about your use of our Services. Such Personal Data may be used, for example, to provide an experience optimized for your device.
            <br /><br />
            <u>Location Information.</u> When you use our Services, we may collect and store information about your location by converting your IP address into a rough geo-location or by accessing your device’s GPS coordinates or coarse location if you enable location services on your device. We may use such Personal Data to improve and personalize our Services for you, for example, by automatically determining the best route for your trip.
            <br /><br />
            <u>Personal Data you give us about other Users.</u> You may give us Personal Data about other Users, for example, other travelers who are planning the trip with you. We should point out that it is your responsibility to ensure the Users you have provided information about are aware that you’ve done so, and have accepted our Privacy Policy.
            <br /><br />
            <u>Other usages.</u> In addition to above usages, we may use your Personal Data to provide a more personalized experience, solicit feedback from you, for quality assurance, for customer support, to prevent fraud and scam, and to ensure proper operation of our Services.
            <br /><br />

        </p>
        <p><strong style="font-size:25px">The Security of Your Personal Data</strong></p>
        <p>
            We take reasonable administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect the information that we collect from or about you (including your PII) from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Our website is secured with HTTPS. However, submission platforms that lead to our Services may not have the same level of security. Please be aware that no method of transmitting information over the Internet or storing information is completely secure. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of any information.
            <br /><br />
            <u>Cloud Service Providers.</u> Please also be aware that we may also use third-party cloud service providers that provide hosting,
            data storage, data processing, backups, data analytics, logging, monitoring, and other services pursuant to standard terms and
            conditions that may be nonnegotiable. These service providers have informed us or the general public that they apply
            security measures they consider adequate for the protection of Personal Data within their system, or they have a general reputation
            for applying such measures. However, we will not be liable (to the fullest extent permitted by law) for any damages that may result
            from the misuse of any information, including Personal Data, by these companies.
            <br /><br />

        </p>

        <p><strong style="font-size:25px">Our Policy Toward Children</strong></p>
        <p>
            Our Services are not directed to children under 18 and we do not knowingly collect PII from children under 18. If we learn that we have collected PII of a
            child under 18 we will take steps to delete such information from our files as soon as possible.
            <br /><br />

        </p>
